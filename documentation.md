# Project Folder Structure Documentation

## Overview
The project is organized to support a scalable, maintainable, and modular Python application, using the Panel library for web-based interfaces. The structure follows best practices for separation of concerns, feature modularity, and future extensibility.

## Structure Breakdown

- **main.py**  
  The entry point of the application. This script is responsible for initializing and serving the main Panel app. Keeping the entry point at the root makes it easy to locate and run the application.

- **readme.md**  
  Provides setup instructions and documentation for users and developers, improving onboarding and collaboration.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all Python dependencies, ensuring reproducibility and easy environment setup.

- **whateels/**  
  The main application package. This encapsulates all core logic, features, and assets, keeping the root directory clean.

  - **__init__.py**  
    Marks the directory as a Python package and can be used to expose high-level app components.

  - **assets/**  
    Contains static files such as CSS and images. This separation allows for easy management of styling and media resources.

    - **css/**  
      Stores all CSS files for custom styling.
    - **img/**  
      Stores image assets used in the application.

  - **features/**  
    Houses all feature modules, each in its own subdirectory. This modular approach allows for independent development and testing of features.

    - **__init__.py**  
      Imports all features for easy access and auto-discovery.

    - **feature_0/**, **feature_1/**  
      Each feature is a self-contained package with its own:
        - **controller/**: Handles business logic and user interaction.
        - **model/**: Manages data and state.
        - **views/**: Contains UI components and layouts (e.g., home.py).
      This MVC-like separation improves maintainability and testability.

- **tests/**  
  Keeps test code separate from production code, supporting best practices in software development.

## Why This Structure?

- **Modularity:**  
  Each feature is isolated, making it easy to add, remove, or update features without affecting others.

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  By dividing code into controllers, models, and views, the project is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

- **Scalability:**  
  As the project grows, new features can be added as new subfolders under features/, and new assets can be added under assets/.

- **Reusability:**  
  Common logic and components can be shared across features, reducing code duplication.

- **Clarity:**  
  The structure is intuitive for new developers, with clear entry points and logical grouping of files.

- **Best Practices:**  
  Follows Python and web app conventions, making it compatible with tooling, testing, and deployment workflows.

This structure is well-suited for a scalable Panel application with multiple features. Itâ€™s easy to navigate and extend, and supports best practices for professional Python development.
