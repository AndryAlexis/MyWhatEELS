class TempFile:
    """
    A class to handle temporary file creation and cleanup with optional delayed deletion.
    
    This class provides a context manager to create a temporary file that is automatically deleted
    when the context is exited. It can be used to safely handle temporary files without leaving
    them on the filesystem.
    
    Features:
    - Cross-platform temporary file creation
    - Automatic cleanup on context exit
    - Optional delayed deletion (non-blocking, uses background thread)
    - Retry logic for Windows file locking issues
    - Preserves file extensions for library compatibility
    
    Args:
        suffix (str): File extension (e.g., '.dm3', '.tmp'). Default: ''
        prefix (str): Filename prefix. Default: 'tmp_'
        dir (str, optional): Directory for temp file. Default: system temp directory
        delay_seconds (int): Seconds to wait before deletion. Default: 0 (immediate)
                           If > 0, deletion happens in background thread (non-blocking)
    
    Example:
        # Immediate deletion (recommended for production)
        with TempFile(suffix='.dm3', prefix='eels_') as temp_path:
            # Process file at temp_path
            pass  # File deleted immediately when exiting
        
        # Delayed deletion (useful for debugging)
        with TempFile(suffix='.dm3', prefix='eels_', delay_seconds=5) as temp_path:
            # Process file at temp_path
            pass  # File scheduled for deletion in 5 seconds (non-blocking)
