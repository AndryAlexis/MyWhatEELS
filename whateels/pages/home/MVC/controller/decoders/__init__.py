Decoders Module for DM3/DM4 File Format

This module provides low-level binary data reading functions specifically 
designed for decoding Gatan DigitalMicrograph files (DM3/DM4 format).

The decoders handle various data types with proper endianness support:
- Integer types: short, long, long_long (signed and unsigned variants)
- Floating point: float, double
- Character types: char, byte, boolean

Functions
